## Resource Editors
Many development packages will include an RC script editor. For example Visual Studio has one as part of its development package. There are also a few third party RC editors as well. I personally have been using [ResEd (On Sourceforge)](https://sourceforge.net/p/fbedit/code/HEAD/tree/ResEd22/) by Ketil Olsen for over a decade now. It is a very capable program and is completely free. Download [ResEd.zip](https://sourceforge.net/p/fbedit/code/HEAD/tree/ResEd22/ResEd.zip?format=raw) from sourceforge if you want to try it out.

Note that while you can write your scripts in VSCode, I highly recommend using a dedicated editor for the bulk of your editing, then use VSCode for fine tuning your scripts.
